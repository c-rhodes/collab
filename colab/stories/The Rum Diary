n the early Fifties, when San Juan first became a tourist town, an ex-jockey
named Al Arbonito built a bar in the patio behind his house on Calle O'Leary. He
called it Al's Backyard and hung a sign above his doorway on the street, with an
arrow pointing between two ramshackle buildings to the patio in back. At first he
served nothing but beer, at twenty cents a bottle, and rum, at a dime a shot or fifteen
cents with ice. After several months he began serving hamburgers, which he made
himself.
