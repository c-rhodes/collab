Far out in the uncharted backwaters of
the unfashionable end of the west
ern spiral arm of the Galaxy
lies a small unregarded yellow sun.

nety-two million miles is an
utterly insignificant little blue green
planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly pr
imitive that they still think digital watches are a
pretty neat idea.
