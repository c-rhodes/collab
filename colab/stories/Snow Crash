The Deliverator belongs to an elite order, a hallowed subcategory. He's got
esprit up to here. Right now, he is preparing to carry out his third mission of
the night. His uniform is black as activated charcoal, filtering the very light
out of the air. A bullet will bounce off its arachnofiber weave like a wren
hitting a patio door, but excess perspiration wafts through it like a breeze
through a freshly napalmed forest, Where his body has bony extremities, the suit
has sintered armorgel: feels like gritty jello, protects like a stack of
telephone books.
