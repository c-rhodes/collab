A SQUAT grey building of only thirty-four stories. Over the main en- 
trance the words, CENTRAL LONDON HATCHERY AND CONDITIONING 
CENTRE, and, in a shield, the World State's motto, COMMUNITY, IDEN- 
TITY, STABILITY. 

The enormous room on the ground floor faced towards the north. Cold 
for all the summer beyond the panes, for all the tropical heat of the 
room itself, a harsh thin light glared through the windows, hungrily 
seeking some draped lay figure, some pallid shape of academic goose- 
flesh, but finding only the glass and nickel and bleakly shining porce- 
lain of a laboratory. Wintriness responded to wintriness. The overalls of 
the workers were white, their hands gloved with a pale corpse- 
coloured rubber. The light was frozen, dead, a ghost. Only from the 
yellow barrels of the microscopes did it borrow a certain rich and living 
substance, lying along the polished tubes like butter, streak after 
luscious streak in long recession down the work tables.
