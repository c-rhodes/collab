 am seated in an office, surrounded by
heads and bodies. My posture is consciously congruent to the shape of my hard chair.
This is a cold room in University Administration, wood-walle
d, Remington-hung, double-windowed against the November heat,
insulated from Administrative sounds by th
e reception area outside, at which Uncle Charle
s, Mr. deLint and I were lately receiv
ed.
I am in here.
Three faces have resolved into place above summer-weight spor
tcoats and half-Windsors across a polished pine conference
table shiny with the spidered light of an Arizona noon. Thes
e are three Deans â€” of Admissions
, Academic Affairs, Athletic
Affairs. I do not know wh
ich face belongs to whom.
I believe I appear neutral, maybe even pleasant, though I've been coached to err on the side of neutrality and not attempt what
would feel to me like a pleasant expression or smile.
