KEITH TALENT WAS
a bad guy. Keith Talent was a very bad guy. You
might even say that he was the worst guy. But not
the
worst, not
the very worst ever. There
were
worse guys. Where? There in the hot
light of CostCheck for example, with car keys, beige singlet, and a
six-pack of Peculiar Brews, the scuffle at the door, the foul threat and
the elbow in the black neck of the wailing lady, then the car with its
rust and its waiting blonde, and off to do the next thing, whatever,
whatever necessary. The mouths on these worst guys - the eyes on
them. Within those eyes a tiny unsmiling universe. No. Keith wasn't
k
that
bad. He had saving graces. He didn't hate people for ready-
made reasons. He was at least
multiracial
in outlook -
thoughtlessly, helplessly so. Intimate encounters with strange-hued
women had sweetened him somewhat. His saving graces all had
names. What with the Fetnabs and Fatimas he had known, the
Nketchis and Iqbalas, the Michikos and Boguslawas, the
Ramsarwatees and Rajashwaris - Keith was, in this sense, a man of
the world. These were the chinks in his coal-black armour: God bless
them all.
