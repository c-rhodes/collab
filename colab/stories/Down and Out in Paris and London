The rue du Coq d’Or, Paris, seven in the morning. A
succession of furious, choking yells from the street.
Madame Monce, who kept the little hotel opposite mine,
had come out on to the pavement to address a lodger on the
third floor. Her bare feet were stuck into sabots and her grey
hair was streaming down.
MADAME MONCE: ‘SALOPE! SALOPE! How many
times have I told you not to squash bugs on the wallpaper?
Do you think you’ve bought the hotel, eh? Why can’t you
throw them out of the window like everyone else? PUTAIN!
SALOPE!
